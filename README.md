### Hi there, it's masterPreshy ðŸ‘‹
Thank you for stopping by my profile today.

ðŸ’¬ I like to discuss Software Development, Cyber Security, Python and Php.

Ps. Although these days, I think I'm falling in love with vuejs ðŸ¤«(Don't tell anyone!).

âœ¨ I believe that there is so much left to build... and I'm looking to collaborate and contribute to build a future where data and products can be leveraged to serve people, create value, and improve quality of life.

ðŸ”­ Whenever I'm not building, you can find me trying out a tasty meal/punch or by the beach side eating turkey with a glass of Wine.ðŸŒ±ðŸ˜‹

âš¡ Currently, I lead engineering at [Vesicash](https://vesicash.com) and I write technical articles at [Vesicash Engineering](https://engineering.vesicash.com)
